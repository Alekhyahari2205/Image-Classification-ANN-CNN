# Image-Classification-ANN-CNN
Considered the cifar10 dataset which includes almost 50,000 images.
Created a prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks with 3 deep layers using activation functions : Relu and Sigmoid and conducted the evalaution for 5 epochs, still the accuracy was 47% which is not desirable.

Implemented Convolution Neural Networks, with 2 activation functions : Relu and Softmax with 10 epochs and achieved a accuracy of 78% 
later evaluated the accuracy in test data set and obtained almost 70% accuracy 
tried to visualize the predictions for first 5 values.

**Comparisions between Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks**

considering the same dataset the accuracy obtained after 5 epochs in 
ANN  -  49%
CNN  -  70%

Hence we can conclude that convolutional Neural Networks better than Artificial Neural Networks.
